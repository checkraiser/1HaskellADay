Majority Element solved by 952 as of February 9th, 2017

Problem

An array A[1..n] is said to have a majority element if more than half of its 
entries are the same.

Given: A positive integer k <= 20, a positive integer n <= 10e4, and k arrays of
size n containing positive integers not exceeding 10e5

Return: For each array, output an element of this array occurring strictly more 
than n/2 times if such element exists, and "-1" otherwise.

sample :: String
sample = unlines ["4 8","5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5","8 7 7 7 1 7 3 7",
                  "7 1 6 5 10 100 1000 1","5 1 6 7 1 1 10 1"]

result :: String
result = "5 7 -1 -1"

Discussion

It is not difficult to develop a divide-and-conquer algorithm checking whether a
given array of size n contains a majority element in O(nlogn) time. It is 
interesting to note that there is also a linear time algorithm and it is also 
based on divide-and-conquer.
--}

-- "It is not difficult to develop a divide-and-conquer algorithm..." WHAAAA?

-- Okay, anyway, first we need a set of parsers, one for the first line
-- (because obviously, we can't ignore the first line, can we?) and then for
-- the lists that follow

parseMetadata :: String -> (Int, Int)
parseMetadata line =
  case line of
    k:_:n:[] -> (digitToInt k, digitToInt n)
    otherwise -> error "Wrong format."

parseList :: String -> [Int]
parseList line = map read $ words line :: [Int]

-- so we parse the metadata in the first line, then in each line thereafter
-- we parse that line as a list to 'not difficult develop a divide-and-conquer
-- algorithm' to solve the problem. Yeah. Right. lol.

-- Well, anyway.

-- Declaratively, we need to scan a list and determine what is the majority
-- element value is, be it -1 for no such element or x where x is that element

majorityElement :: Int -> [Int] -> Int
majorityElement lengthList list =
  maybe
    (-1)
    (fst)
    (find
       (\(x,c) -> c > (lengthList `div` 2))
       ((\x -> (x, execState (count x list) 0)) <$> (nub list)))

count :: Int -> [Int] -> State Int ()
count n xs =
  foldl
    (\acc x ->
       if x == n
         then acc >> modify (1 +)
         else acc)
    (put 0)
    xs

-- now, how you do that, it's up to you.

-- Question. Is it always necessary to scan the entire list each time to find
-- the value of majorityElement? I think it's not necessary. Your thoughts?

-- | Okay, so let's tie this together 
--
-- Examples:
--
-- >>> (unwords $ show <$> majorityElements sample) == result
-- True
majorityElements :: String -> [Int]
majorityElements inputData =
  let (h:t) = lines inputData
  in majorityElement (snd $ parseMetadata h) . parseList <$> t

-- of course, the format of the output is a string. Hint: see Friday's
-- problem for a discussion on that (imported above).

-- AND we need to input up to 20 very large lists (with meta data) and output
-- up to 20 majority elements (that we can just visually inspect), so:

largeDataSetMajorityElements :: FilePath -> IO String
largeDataSetMajorityElements gzippedInputFile = undefined

-- run the above against Y2017/M02/D13/rosalind_maj.txt.gz. What is your result?
